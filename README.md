# project-bueller
An open source attendance tracking system for meetup groups.

## History
This project is being started by members of the freeCodeCamp Chicago Study Group and is initially being developed for our use in keeping track of attendance at our in-person meetups. We hope that eventually this becomes useful for others looking for a way to keep track of attendance at their meetups (or really any gathering where tracking attendance is useful).
